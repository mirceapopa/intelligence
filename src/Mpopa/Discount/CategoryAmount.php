/**
 * Requirement 2: For every product of category "Switches" (id 2), when you buy five, you get a sixth for free.
 * 
 * The class receives $category_id (defaults to 2) and $products_nr (defaults to 5) parameters.
 * If you call CategoryAmount($order, 4, 10), it will apply the same rule of disount, but for 
 * the 4th category, and for a group of 10 items.
 * 
 * It applies for every individual product type. For example if a customer orders 5xBasic on-off switch and 7xPress button, the discount will
 * include 1x Basic on-off switch and also 1xPress button
 * 
 * NOTE: If the customer orders for example 10 products from category 2, the customer will receive 2 more free (one for each 5 products group).
 *       If the customer orders 7 products for example, it will receive only 1 free, because only one full group of 5 products was bought
 *       Discounts are not cumulative.
